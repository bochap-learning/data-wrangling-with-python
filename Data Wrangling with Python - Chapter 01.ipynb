    "## Introduction to Data Wrangling\n",
    "\n",
    "Data wrangling, sometimes referred to as data munging, is the process of transforming and mapping data from one \"raw\" data form into another format with the intent of making it more appropriate and valuable for a variety of downstream purposes such as analytics. It is generally done at the very first stage of a data science/ analytics pipeline. And it involves the following\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Acquisition: Identify and obtain access to the data within your sources (Web, database, files).\n",
    "2. Joining Data : Combine the edited data for further use and analysis.\n",
    "3. Data Cleansing: Redesign the data into a usable/functional format and correct/remove any bad data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of using Python for data wrangling\n",
    "1. General purpose open source paradigm putting no restriction on any of the methods you can develop for the specific problem at hand\n",
    "2. Great ecosystem of fast, optimized, open source libraries focused on data analytics\n",
    "3. Growing support to connect Python to every conceivable data source type. And ability to write code to connect to unsupported data sources\n",
    "4. Easy interface to data manipulation and visualization libraries to check data quality\n",
    "5. Ability to call C libraries direct using Python as the coding language for performance.\n",
    "6. Strong support for GPU that provides performance booast for data crunching\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lists, Sets, Strings, Tuples, and Dictionaries\n",
    "This section introduces the various basic data structures in Python. They provide the foundations to manipulate data in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### LISTS\n",
    "Lists are fundamental Python data structures that have the following properties\n",
    "- continuous memory locations\n",
    "- host different data types\n",
    "- accessed by the index."

You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.\"\\n\\n\"Is that his design in settling here?\"\\n\\n\"Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes.\"\\n\\n\"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the party.\"\\n\\n\"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.\"\\n\\n\"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.\"\\n\\n\"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood.\"\\n\\n\"It is more than I engage for, I assure you.\"\\n\\n\"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him if you do not.\"\\n\\n\"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.\"\\n\\n\"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference.\"\\n\\n\"They have none of them much to recommend them,\" replied he; \"they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves.\"\\n\\n\"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these last twenty years at least.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, you do not know what I suffer.\"\\n\\n\"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.\"\\n\\n\"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them.\"\\n\\n\"Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all.\"\\n\\nMr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. Her mind was less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news. \\n'"
